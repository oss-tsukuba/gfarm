<H2>Certificate Authority</H2>

The public key of trusted certificate authorities are stored at
/etc/grid-security/certificates as a form of HASH.0.  A signing policy
file is also required.

<H2>Host certificate</H2>

For gfmd, a host certificate is required, which should be stored at
/etc/grid-security/host{cert,key}.pem by default.  The location can be
changed by X509_USER_{CERT,KEY} environment variables.

<H2>Gfsd service certificate</H2>

For gfsd, a gfsd service certificate is required, which should be
stored at /etc/grid-security/gfsd/gfsd{cert,key}.pem by default.  The
location can be changed by X509_USER_{CERT,KEY} environment variables.
The owner of this file should be _gfarmfs.

<H2>User certificate</H2>

For users, a user certificate is required, which should be stored at
$HOME/.globus/user{cert,key}.pem by default.  The location can be
changed by X509_USER_{CERT,KEY} environment variables.

In GSI, a proxy certificate can be generated by grid-proxy-init or
proxy-cert-gen command.  The default location is /tmp/x509up_u${UID}.
The location can be changed by X509_USER_PROXY environment variable.
