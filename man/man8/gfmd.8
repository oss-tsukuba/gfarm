.SH NAME
gfmd(8) \- Gfarm metadata server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfmd\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfmd\fR is a Gfarm filesystem metadata server for accessing
filesystem metadata of the Gfarm filesystem.  \fBgfmd\fR is needed to
be running on a metadata server node in advance.
.PP
It is possible for \fBgfmd\fR to be executed as a non-privileged user
process although other users cannot use it.  Moreover, a \fBgfmd\fR
with a user privilege cannot authenticate using the GSI.
.PP
In order to execute \fBgfmd\fR as a non-privileged user process, a
configuration file for a user needs to be specified by the -f option.
At least, the port number used by \fBgfmd\fR should be altered to a
non-privileged port number by metadb_serverport statement in the
configuration file or the -p option.
.PP
In this case, the altered port number of \fBgfmd\fR should be
specified by the metadb_serverport statement in \fI~/.gfarmrc\fR
or \fI/etc/gfarm.conf\fR on a client node.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fR
specifies the debug mode.  With the -d option, gfmd is running as a
foreground process not a daemon.

\fB-f \fIconfig-file\fB\fR
specifies a configuration file that is read instead of the default
configuration file.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
specifies a port number used by gfmd.  By default, 601 is used.

Default port requires the root privilege, although privileged ports
are not necessary to execute gfmd.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsyslog-facility\fB\fR
specifies a syslog facility to report errors by gfmd.  By default,
local0 is used.
.TP
\fB-u \fI\fB\fR
