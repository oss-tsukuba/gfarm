.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfhost\fR
displays the information of filesystem nodes\&. It also registers a new filesystem node, and modifies and deletes the registered information\&.
.PP
The function of
\fBgfhost\fR
is determined by the option, \-c, \-m, \-d, \-H, \-l, \-M, and \-R\&. These functions are mutually exclusive, and only one option among them can be specified\&. If none of them is specified, filesystem nodes will be listed, which is the default function of
\fBgfhost\fR\&.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.PP
The Gfarm filesystem manages filesystem nodes at the gfmd metadata server\&. The \-c option registers a new filesystem node\&. The \-m option modifies the registered information\&. The \-d option removes an entry of the filesystem node and related file metadata\&. The \-R option restores the dumped information of filesystem nodes, which is obtained by the \-M option\&. These operations require gfarmadm privilege\&.
.PP
The \-H, \-l, \-M, or no functional option is specified,
\fBgfhost\fR
displays filesystem node information\&. The \-M lists the registered information of filesystem nodes at the gfmd metadata server\&. Other options access
\fBgfsd\fR
filesystem daemon to obtain more information and also to check the accessibility to a filesystem node\&. The \-i, \-j, \-U and \-v options are available\&.
.PP
When hostnames of filesystem nodes are not specified, all registered hosts will be displayed, but you can limit the type of hosts displayed by the \-a and/or \-D option\&. By default, hosts are displayed in alphabetical order, but you can change this by the \-L, \-p, or \-r option, although the \-L option is effective with \-H or \-l option\&.
.PP
The following is a list of the functions of the
\fBgfhost\fR
command\&. You shouldn\*(Aqt specify more than one function at a time\&.
.PP
<none>
.RS 4
When no function is specified,
\fBgfhost\fR
accesses to
\fBgfsd\fR, and displays the host names which are currently available\&. They are displayed in alphabetical order, by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR
.RS 4
Creates a host entry of a filesystem node that is specified by the argument\&. The \-a option is mandatory, which specifies the architecture of the filesystem node\&. The \-p option is mandatory, which specifies the port number of
\fBgfsd\fR
on the filesystem node\&. The \-n option is optional, which specifies the number of CPUs of the filesystem node\&. When it is omitted, 1 CPU is assumed\&. The \-f option is optional, which specifies the flag of the file system node\&. When it is omitted, 0 is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Deletes a host entry\&. All file metadata is also asynchronously updated to delete invalid replica entries for the removed filesystem node, and to create file replicas if required, automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR
.RS 4
Displays in a long format, which consists of the CPU load average, authentication method, architecture, the number of CPUs, hostname, port number, flags, and the IP address\&.
.sp
If the host cannot be accessed due to a machine down or a network problem, etc\&., x\&.xx/x\&.xx/x\&.xx will be displayed in the CPU load average field\&. If the host is up, but
\fBgfsd\fR
on the host cannot be accessed, \-\&.\-\-/\-\&.\-\-/\-\&.\-\- will be displayed\&.
.sp
In the field of the authentication method, `T\*(Aq means the client certificate authentication over TLS, `S\*(Aq means the Gfarm shared secret authentication over TLS, `A\*(Aq means SASL authentication over TLS, `a\*(Aq means SASL authentication over TLS but the plain communication after the authentication, `K\*(Aq means the Kerberos authentication and the encrypted communication, `k\*(Aq means the Kerberos authentication and the plain communication, `G\*(Aq means the GSI authentication and the encryption, `g\*(Aq means only authentication is performed by GSI and actual communication is unprotected plain data (gsi_auth), `s\*(Aq means the gfarm sharedsecret authentication, `x\*(Aq means that the authentication fails, and `\-\*(Aq means that the authentication wasn\*(Aqt actually tried\&. With the \-U option, there is no authentication method field\&.
.sp
In the field of the flags, refer to the \-f option\&.
.sp
Hostnames are displayed in alphabetical order, by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-H\fR
.RS 4
Displays filesystem nodes with the CPU load average and the authentication method\&. This function also displays the IP address used to access to
\fBgfsd\fR
in parentheses just after the hostname\&.
.sp
For the field of the CPU load average and the authentication method, refer to the \-l option\&.
.sp
Hostnames are displayed in alphabetical order, by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR
.RS 4
Dumps the metadata information of the registered filesystem nodes\&. Hostnames are displayed in alphabetical order, by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR
.RS 4
Modifies the registered metadata information of the filesystem node\&. The \-a, \-p, \-n, and/or \-f option modify the current value of each option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R\fR
.RS 4
Restores the metadata information read from standard input\&. The format of the metadata is same as the format that the \-M function displays\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR
.RS 4
Prints usage\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a\fR \fIarchitecture\fR
.RS 4
This option specifies the CPU architecture using a format like sparc\-sun\-solaris8 or i386\-redhat8\&.0\-linux, etc\&. If this option is used with the \-c or \-m function, this means the architecture used to add/modify the metadata information\&. If this option is used with \-H, \-l, \-M function or default function, this limits hosts to the specified architecture\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR \fIdomain\-name\fR
.RS 4
This option is used with the \-H, \-l, \-M function or the default function to limit hosts to the specified domain\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR
.RS 4
There is an "address_use" directive in %%SYSCONFDIR%%/gfarm2\&.conf and $HOME/\&.gfarm2rc to give priorities of network addresses for gfarm access\&. This directive works with the
\fBgfhost\fR
command, but will be ignored, if you specified the \-i option with
\fBgfhost\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j\fR \fIconcurrency\fR
.RS 4
This option specifies the concurrency used for access to
\fBgfsd\fR\&. The default value is 10\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L\fR
.RS 4
Sorts by load average order\&. This option is effective only with the \-H and \-l functions
\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR \fInumber\-of\-CPUs\fR
.RS 4
This option is used with the \-c or \-m function, and specifies the number of CPUs of the host\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIport\-number\fR
.RS 4
This option is used with \-c or \-m function, and specifies the port number of
\fBgfsd\fR
on the host\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIflags\fR
.RS 4
This option is used with \-c or \-m function, and specifies the flags of
\fBgfsd\fR
on the host\&. Values of flags are constructed by a bitwise\-or of the following list\&.
.PP
\fB1\fR
.RS 4
readonly
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
This option specifies a pathname or a Gfarm URL to identify a metadata server which will be accessed by this command\&. If not specified, "/" is used as the default value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Reverses the order of sort\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR
.RS 4
Plain order\&. This option stops sorting on the \-H, \-l, \-M function or the default function\&. With the \-M function, command argument order (if any), or the order that the metadata server answers is used for display\&. With the \-H, \-l function or the default function, the result is displayed in the order that each
\fBgfsd\fR
answers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses authentication attempts by TCP, and only queries load average by UDP\&. This option only makes sense if you specified the \-H or \-l function, or if you didn\*(Aqt specify any function\&. This option makes the gfhost command run faster\&. If the \-H or \-l function is specified, this option makes the authentication method field disappear\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
The \-H, \-l function and the default function don\*(Aqt produce error reports on
\fBgfsd\fR
accesses; these error reports will be produced by this option\&.
