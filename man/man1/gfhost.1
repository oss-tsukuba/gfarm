\fBgfhost\fR \fB-R\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfhost\fR is used to display and maintain
information about filesystem nodes. The function that 
\fBgfhost\fR does is choosed by its option -c, -d,
-H, -l, -M, -m, -R.
Theses functions are mutually exclusive, and only one option
of them can be specified.
If none of them is specified, host name will be displayed as
the default function of \fBgfhost\fR.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.PP
Metadata in LDAP server will be accessed by function -c, -d, -M, -m and
-R. These functions add/delete/display/modify/restore host information
in the metadata.
.PP
If -H, -l or -M is specified, or none of functions are specified,
\fBgfhost\fR displays information of filesystem node.
-M function only accesses information in metadata server.
Display functions other than -M also access \fBgfsd\fR
which is running on filesystem nodes. For functions which access
\fBgfhost\fR, the access option can be specified
by option -i, -j, -U and -v.
.PP
You don't have to specify hostnames for display functions.
In that case, all hosts which are registered in metadata will be
tried to be displayed, and you can limit type of hosts to display
by -a or -D option.
By default, hosts are displayed by alphabetical order, but you can
change this by -L, -p, and -r options. Although -L option is ignored
in -M function  and default function
\&.
.PP
The followings are the list of functions of \fBgfhost\fR
command. You shouldn't specify more than one functions at once.
.TP
\fB<none>\fR
If you don't specify none of the functions,
\fBgfhost\fR accesses \fBgfsd\fR,
and displays names of hosts which are available currently,
as its default function.
Hostnames are displayed by alphabetical order, by default.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Create metadata information for the host which is specified
in the argument.
Option -a is mandatory in this function, this option specifies
the architecture of the host.
Option -n may be used to specify number of CPU of the host,
and 1 CPU is assumed, if -n is omitted.

You can specifiy multiple hostnames in this function.
In that case, first hostname is treated as the identifier of
the host, and the host identifier is used for replication
information management. Rest of hostnames are used as aliases
of the host.

If a host has multiple network interfaces, and each interface
has unique hostname, all of the hostnames must be registered
as either host identifier or host aliases.

If /etc/hosts or NIS hosts database doesn't contain DNS domain
name part in its hostnames (i.e. these hostnames are not Fully
Qualified Domain Names), you must register host alias.
In that case, you must register FQDN (hostname which contain
domain name part) as the host identifier, and 
register names without domain part as the host alias.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Delete host information from metadata.
Currently, even hosts which are refered by
replica catalog can be deleted. But be careful, because
such deletion causes incosistency of metadata.
Only host identifier can be used as hostname
in this function.
.TP
\fB-H\fR
Display load average and authentication method.
With this function, the exact hostname passed by gfhost command
arguments will be displayed instead of canonical host identifier.
Also, this function displays the IP address which is used to
access \fBgfsd\fR in parentheses just after the hostname.

If the host cannot be accessed due to machine down or
network trouble etc., x.xx/x.xx/x.xx will be displayed in
the load average field.
If the host is up, but \fBgfsd\fR on the host
cannot be accessed by the port number configured in
/etc/gfarm.conf or $HOME/.gfarmrc, -.--/-.--/-.-- will be
displayed.

The next field is the authenticaion method used with the
host. `G' in this field means GSI authenticaion, `S' means
gfarm sharedsecret authentication, `x' means that the
authentication failed, and `-' means that the authentication
wasn't actually tried. If -U option is specified, this
authentication method field won't be provided.

Hostnames are displayed by alphabetical order, by default.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Display with long format.
This function displays both information retrieved from gfsd
and metadata server.
The types of information retrieved from gfsd are load average and
authentication method.
And the types of information retrieved from metadata server are
architecture name, number of CPUs, host identifier
and host aliases (if any).
IP address will be displayed in parentheses just after the
hostname used for the access to \fBgfsd\fR.

If the host cannot be accessed due to machine down or
network trouble etc., x.xx/x.xx/x.xx will be displayed in
the load average field.
If the host is up, but \fBgfsd\fR on the host
cannot be accessed by the port number configured in
/etc/gfarm.conf or $HOME/.gfarmrc, -.--/-.--/-.-- will be
displayed.

The next field is the authenticaion method used with the
host. `G' in this field means GSI authenticaion, `S' means
gfarm sharedsecret authentication, `x' means that the
authentication failed, and `-' means that the authentication
wasn't actually tried. If -U option is specified, this
authentication method field won't be provided.

Hostnames are displayed by alphabetical order, by default.
.TP
\fB-M\fR
Metadata information of the hosts will be displayed.
Hostnames are displayed by alphabetical order, by default.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Modify metadata information of the host, by specifying
the host identifier.
-a option and -n option overwrite current value of each option.
By contrast, host aliases will be added in this function by default.
If you want to replace or delete host aliases, please specify
-A option with this function. In that case, all host aliases
will be replaced by specified aliases (if any).
.TP
\fB-R\fR
Restore metadata information read from standard input.
The format of the metadata is same with the format
that -M function displays.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Print usage.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Alter. This option is used with -m function to replace
host aliases, rather than adding.
.TP
\fB-a \fIarchitecture\fB\fR
This option specifies the CPU architecture by a format like
sparc-sun-solaris8 or i386-redhat8.0-linux, etc.
If this option is used with -c or -m function, this means
the architecture to add/modify the metadata information.
If this option is used with -H, -l, -M function or default function,
this limits hosts to the specified architecture.
.TP
\fB-D \fIdomain-name\fB\fR
This option is used with -H, -l, -M function or default function
to limit hosts to the specified domain.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
There is "address_use" directive in /etc/gfarm.conf and
$HOME/.gfarmrc to give priorities of network addresses
for gfarm access.
This directive works with \fBgfhost\fR command,
but will be ignored, if you specified -i option with
\fBgfhost\fR.
.TP
\fB-j \fIconcurrency\fB\fR
This option specifies concurrency used for the access to
\fBgfsd\fR.
The default value is 10.
.TP
\fB-L\fR
Sort by load average order. This option is effective only with
-H and -l function .
.TP
\fB-n \fInumber-of-CPUs\fB\fR
This option is used with -c or -m function, and specifies
number of CPUs of the host.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Plain order. This option stops sorting on -H, -l, -M function
or default function.
With -M function, command argument order (if any), or
order that metadata server answers is used for a display.
With -H, -l function or default function, the result
is displayed with the order that each \fBgfsd\fR answers.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Reverse the order of sort.
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Suppress authentication attempts by TCP, and only query
load average by UDP.
This option only makes sense, if you specified -H or -l function,
or if you don't specify any function.
If -l function is specified, this option makes the authentication
method field disappear.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
-H, -l function and default function don't produce any error
report about the \fBgfsd\fR accesss.
Such error report will be produced by this option.
