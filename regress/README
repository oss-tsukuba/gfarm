TO RUN TEST

1. "/tmp" directory must exist and must be writable by the user who will
  run this test.
  e.g. the following should be done by a gfarm administrator:
	gfmkdir /tmp
	gfchmod 1777 /tmp

2. prepare some optional tests
  although this is optional, it's STRONGLY recommended to do this.

  this is long, see "SETTING UP TEST ENVIRONMENT" section below.

3. run "make" (for production_test) or "make check" (for development)

optional variables:
	$GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH=<path>
		... pathname of a gfarm file which causes cksum mismatch
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS2=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS3=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd
	$GFARM_TEST_MDS4=<host>:<port>	... optional gfmd

optional conditions:
	- whether this user have the gfarmadm group privilege or not.
	- whether this user have the gfarmroot group privilege or not.
	- whether there are at least two filesystem nodes or not.
	- whether there are at least two users or not.
	- whether XML attribute is enabled by the configure command or not.
	- whether cksum calculation is enabled or not.
	- whether client-side cksum calculation is enabled or not.
	- which cksum type is set
	- whether $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH is set or not
	- the $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH is larger than client_file_bufsize
	- whether $GFARM_TEST_MDS* is set or not


TO RUN ALL TESTS

to run all tests, the following conditions have to be tested.
  * with or without the gfarmroot group privilege
  * run tests on a host which is NOT a filesystem node, and
    run tests on a file system node which has a replica of
    the $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH file.

There is a script "addup.sh" to make summary of multiple test outputs.

Thus, you can run all tests by the following procedure:
  1. on a host which is NOT a filesystem node,
     run tests by a privileged user who is in the gfarmroot group, e.g.
	$ LANG=C ./regress.sh -l log.w_root.remote
  2. on a file system node which has a replica of $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH,
     run tests by a non-privileged user who is NOT in the gfarmroot group, e.g.
	$ LANG=C ./regress.sh -l log.wo_root.local
  3. make summary of the log outputs, e.g.
	$ ./addup.sh log.w_root.remote log.wo_root.local
     you can specify "-v" option to addup.sh to see whole test result matrix.


TO WRITE TEST
- each test should be independent from other test.
i.e.
- each test shouldn't assume the order of the tests.
- each test should clear the changes made by the test before exiting.
- each test should be able to be executed simultaneously on multiple hosts
  and multiple "make check" on same host.
  that means names of temporary files should be unique even on different hosts.
  $gftmp variable includes a hostname as well as PID due to this reason.
  $localtmp only includes PID because it's only used for a local filesystem
  instead of a gfarm filesystem.
- each test should preserve filesystem contents and user, group,
  host and fsngroup settings.  although it's OK to change them temporarily
  during the test.


NOTES
- if you are using the builddir feature, use "${srcdir}/makes/make.sh"
  instead of "make".


TODO
- test by root?

SETTING UP TEST ENVIRONMENT

----------------------------------------
SETTING UP CKSUM RELATED TESTS
----------------------------------------

BASIC SETTING

  - you should have the following setting in your gfmd.conf for
    all metadata servers:
	  digest md5
    ("digest sha1" is also OK)

    if this setting is newly added, you have to restart gfmd.
    if you haven't set up your metadata servers yet, adding the "-d md5" option
    to the config-gfarm command does this automatically.

    if you don't have this setting, Gfarm won't calculate any cksum,
    thus, the results of the cksum related tests will be UNSUPPORTED.

  - you should have the following setting in your gfarm2.conf for
    your Gfarm clients:
	  client_digest_check enable

    if you don't have this setting, the results of the client-side cksum tests
    (cksum*.local.sh) will be UNSUPPORTED.

SETTING ABOUT $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH

  you should have a Gfarm file which contents do not match with
  cksum metadata of the file.
  you should set the $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH environment varaible
  to the pathname of the Gfarm file.

  if you don't have this setting, the results of cksum_mismatch*.sh tests
  and cksum_no_check.*.sh tests will be UNSUPPORTED.

  You can choose an arbitrary pathname as $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH.
  The following description assumes that the environment variable is already
  set by you.

  To create the Gfarm file which contents do not match with cksum metadata
  of the file, you should follow the procedure below.

  - choose a filesystem node which holds the contents of the Gfarm file.
    we call this filesystem node FILESYSTEM-NODE-1 in this description.

  - make sure you have the following line in gfarm2.conf for gfsd
    on FILESYSTEM-NODE-1:
	spool_digest_error_check disable

    if this setting is newly added, you have to restart gfsd.

    if you don't have this setting, the Gfarm file which is pointed by
    $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH will be moved to /lost+found automatically
    as soon as cksum mismatch is detected, so subsequent regression tests
    about the Gfarm file won't be executed.
    the "spool_digest_error_check disable" setting prevents this automatic
    movement to /lost+found.

  - to register a file on FILESYSTEM-NODE-1, run the following command (*1):

	$ printf '%4194308s' ' ' | gfreg -h FILESYSTEM-NODE-1 - $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH

  - then, you should see the relative pathname of this file from gfsd spool,
    by running the following command:

	$ gfspoolpath $GFARM_TEST_CKSUM_MISMATCH

    you should remember the output of this command.
    this output will be refered as "data/ABCDEF01/23/45/67/89ABCDEF0123456789"
    in description below.

  - to make cksum mismatch, you should replace the contents of the Gfarm file
    by running the following command with root privilege on FILESYSTEM-NODE-1:

	# printf '%4194307sX' ' ' > /PATH/TO/CONFIG_PREFIX/var/gfarm-spool/data/ABCDEF01/23/45/67/89ABCDEF0123456789

    NOTE: you should replace the "data/ABCDEF01/23/45/67/89ABCDEF0123456789"
	  part above by the output of the gfspoolpath command.

    NOTE: you should replace the "/PATH/TO/CONFIG_PREFIX/var/gfarm-spool"
	  part above by the spool directory pathname of the gfsd.
	  if you did specify neither --prefix option nor a spool directory
	  argument in the config-gfsd command for this gfsd,
	  the part should be just "/var/gfarm-spool".

   (*1) the file size (4194308 bytes) is chosen to make the file size
        larger than client_file_bufsize.
	if you have spare time, it's recommended to create another file
	which size is smaller than 1MB, and use the small file
	for cksum mismatch tests too.

  That's all.

  If you run "make check" on FILESYSTEM-NODE-1, you can see
  the results of cksum_mismatch*.local.sh and cksum_no_check.local.sh.

  If you run "make check" on a host which is not FILESYSTEM-NODE-1, you can see
  the results of cksum_mismatch*.remote.sh and cksum_no_check.remote.sh.
