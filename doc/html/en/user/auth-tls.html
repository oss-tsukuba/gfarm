TLS Authentication

<HR>
<H1>TLS Authentication</H1>
English | <A href="../../ja/user/auth-tls.html">Japanese</A>
<P>
This document describes the settings required for TLS authentication in Gfarm.
<p>
Gfarm requires TLS 1.3.  OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later is required.
<P>
There are two types of TLS authentication:
tls_sharedsecret authentication,
in which the server and client share a private key,
and tls_client_certificate authentication, which uses a client certificate.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="TLS-common-setting">
    Common settings for tls_sharedsecret,
    tls_client_certificate,
    sasl_auth and sasl authentications</A></H2>

The following settings are common to the two TLS authentication methods,
sasl authentication method and sasl_auth authentication method.

<UL>
<LI>directory containing the Certificate Authority's certificate files
<BR>
Required by all of clients, gfmd, and gfsd.
<BR>
This can be set with the tls_ca_certificate_path directive
and defaults to /etc/pki/tls/certs/gfarm.
<BR>
This directory format is the same as /etc/grid-security/certificates
for GSI authentication methods,
so if your site has already been configured for GSI authentication, simply create a symbolic link with the following command to complete the configuration.
<PRE>
# mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs
# ln -s /etc/grid-security/certificates /etc/pki/tls/certs/gfarm
</PRE>
<BR>
<LI>directory where CRL files provided by the CA are located
<BR>
Required by all of clients, gfmd, and gfsd.
<BR>
The default directory is /etc/pki/tls/certs/gfarm,
which is same with tls_ca_certificate_path.
<BR>
This directory format is also common with /etc/grid-security/certificates
for GSI authentication,
so sites that have already completed the GSI authentication settings
can complete the settings by creating the symbolic link described above.

<BR>
<LI>the host certificate and the private key for gfmd
<BR>
These files are required only on the hosts running gfmd.
<BR>
These can be set by tls_certificate_file and tls_key_file in gfmd.conf,
and the default file name is as follows:
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>host certificate</TH>	<TD>/etc/pki/tls/certs/gfmd.crt</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>private key</TH>	<TD>/etc/pki/tls/private/gfmd.key</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

For sites that have already been configured for GSI authentication,
simply use the following command to create a symbolic link
to complete the configuration.
<PRE>
# mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs /etc/pki/tls/private
# ln -s /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/gfmd.crt
# ln -s /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/pki/tls/private/gfmd.key
</PRE>

<BR>
<LI>the service certificate and the private key for gfsd
<BR>
The following file names can be set by
tls_certificate_file and tls_key_file directives in gfarm2.conf,
which is referred to by gfsd, and is the default setting.
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>service certificate</TH><TD>/etc/pki/tls/certs/gfsd.crt</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>private key</TH>	<TD>/etc/pki/tls/private/gfsd.key</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

However, the X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY environment variables
take precedence over the tls_certificate_file and tls_key_file settings,
respectively.
When gfsd is initially configured using the config-gfsd command,
the tls_certificate_file and tls_key_file directives have no effect
because the following locations are set via these environment variables:
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>service certificate</TH><TD>/etc/grid-security/gfsd/gfsdcert.pem</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>private key</TH>	<TD>/etc/grid-security/gfsd/gfsdkey.pem</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Since these path names are the same as those for GSI authentication,
additional settings are not necessary
for sites that have already completed GSI authentication settings.
<BR>
In order to use a service certificate in gfsd,
the following additional settings are required
for gfarm2.conf of the client, gfarm2.conf of gfsd, and gfmd.conf of gfmd.
<PRE>
spool_server_cred_type host
spool_server_cred_service gfsd
</PRE>
These setting are also common to GSI,
so sites that have already completed GSI certification
do not need to make any additional settings.
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>settings specific to tls_sharedsecret authentication</H2>

For all client, gfmd, and gfsd hosts,
a common key must be placed in the .gfarm_shared_key file
directly under each user's home directory.
<BR>
The configuration of this file is the same
as that of sharedsecret authentication,
so please refer to the description of <A HREF="auth-sharedsecret.html">sharedsecret authentication</A>.

<HR>
<H2>settings specific to tls_client_certificate</H2>

<H3>settings by the administrator</H3>

For each user,
set the Subject DN of the client certificate
in the fourth field of the gfuser command
in the format "/O=Company/OU=Division/CN=UserName".
<BR>
This setting is also common to GSI, so additional settings are not required
for sites that have already been configured for GSI authentication.


<H3>settings by each user</H3>

<UL>
<LI>When proxy certificates are used
<BR>
Proxy certificates created by GSI's grid-proxy-init and myproxy-logon commands
can be used without modification.
Use these commands to create proxy certificates.

<BR>
<LI>When proxy certificates are not used
<BR>
They can be set in tls_certificate_file and tls_key_file in gfarm2.conf
of the client,
and the default file name is as follows in each user's home directory.

<TABLE>
<TR><TH>user certificate</TH>	<TD>.gfarm/usercert.pem</TD></TR>
<TR><TH>private key</TH>	<TD>.gfarm/userkey.pem</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

These files are same to GSI,
so for sites that have already completed GSI certification settings,
simply create a symbolic link with the following command to complete the setup.
<PRE>
$ ln -s .globus $HOME/.gfarm
</PRE>

</UL>
